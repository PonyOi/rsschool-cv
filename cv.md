## Bio
My name is Polina, I'm 30 years old and i live in Moscow.
I've started my career in sales, but after a few years of working in retails I quit, but I've got sales experience.
Then I've started police career. I've been serving since 2013. This job has made me responsible and relaiable person. But as we know it's hard enough to live by police rules. Fortunately I am a shiftworker, so I have time to learn something and develope myself. Firstly I've started learning english, then HTML. Looking forward to try JS.
